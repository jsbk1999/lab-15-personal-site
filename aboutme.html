      <h4>Hi my fellow classmates, my name is Jose Soriano. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I'm a second generation Mexican-American. Both of my parents were also born here in Brooklyn, but my grandparents are from Mexico. I have 5 sisters and two nieces. I was born and raised in Williamsburg, before the gentrification started. This is a picture from google maps of the building I grew up at. </h4>

      <h5>I'm majoring in Entertainment Technology. I always wanted to know what it's like working behind the scenes on things we watch on screen or attend to. When I'm not in school, I like to watch movies, listen to music, read, play video games, and skateboard.

      <h4>I love music so much. My sisters and I grew up listening to hip-hop, r&b, mexican music, reggaeton, and bachata. I started listening to 90's hip-hop more because late Tio (Uncle) Blady and my father made us listen to it all the time. Once I started learning about my uncle music stash, I started loving it more and developed a relationship with this genre. Up to the point that I wanted to make music when I was a junior in high school, but didn't know how until I graduated.
